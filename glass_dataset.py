print('SVM model has better accuracy than Naive Bayes model. This is because SVM model tries to find the best possible decision boundary between the data points of different classes. It tries to maximize the margin between the decision boundary and the data points. On the other hand, Naive Bayes model assumes that the features are independent of each other and tries to find the probability of the data point belonging to a particular class. Hence, SVM model has better accuracy than Naive Bayes model.')
